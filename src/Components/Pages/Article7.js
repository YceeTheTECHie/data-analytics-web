                        <p>Your institution’s most powerful tool is something you’ve already been collecting for years: Big data.

Big data refers to the massive amount of information that we create on a daily basis. Since students, teachers and administrators leave an endless trail of data throughout their time at your institution, this information can be used to gain insight into your performance — both at a high level (your entire institution) and a granular level (individual students).</p>

                            <h3 className="text-center">How Educators Can Use Big Data</h3>
                            <p>Data has been around long before computers, but technology has certainly accelerated the amount created every day. With the mobile devices, the internet of things (IoT), social media and other sources of information, we generate at least 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day!

Clearly, this incredible volume of data is too complex for traditional tools to capture, store and manage. That’s where a data management program comes in. The right software will aggregate all of your necessary data sets and compile them in an easy-to-use, easy-to-understand dashboard. You can learn how to find the right data analytics platform for your school in this article.

Educators, decision makers and stakeholders are leveraging data analytics programs to identify institutional problems and spot opportunities for positive change.</p>
                            <p>Software programs enable analysis and interpretation that spans a diverse range of demographics, and from there you can develop new strategies to propel your institution forward.

                            <h3 className="text-center">The benefits of big data </h3>

                            <p><strong>1. It helps you find answers to hard questions: </strong>  Evaluating your existing data is the best way to strategize solutions to the tough challenges facing the education field. The more you know about your history, the more you will be able to learn from it.

For example, if you’re in higher education you might be seeing enrollments decline.</p>
                            <p> <strong>2. It’s accessible : </strong>
Searching through a wall-to-wall arrangement of file cabinets is messy and time consuming. Since big data relies on a technological infrastructure to capture, store and manage information, it’s much easier to find what you’re looking for.

Beyond infrastructure, institutional silos can also make it difficult to share information. Leadership may be privy to data that teachers don’t have access to, which can create barriers to growth and understanding.

Data analytics, along with the right software, will help you create a more collaborative environment. Since data is available in one centralized location, all you need is internet access to find what you need. Many software tools are available through browsers, like Google Chrome and Safari, so you don’t even need to install a program or plug-in.</p>
                            <p> <strong>3. It helps you adapt: </strong>
By identifying trends, you can develop new classes, teaching strategies and other methods to give students what they need and want.

Take community colleges as an example. These schools are mostly populated by adults who are balancing work, families and their education, so a flexible schedule is one of their requirements when looking for a school. With the expansion of online learning, many of these adult students find online classes to be even more convenient than late night or weekend classes.

Since online learning is better suited for certain types of classes — like ones that don’t require a lab or hands-on learning — big data will show the precise numbers behind this. Maybe on-campus biology class enrollments have been consistent while on-campus English courses have seen a decline. You can adjust your course offerings accordingly to ensure you’re always offering the best options for your students.

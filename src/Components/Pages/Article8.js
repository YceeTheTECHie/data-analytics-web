                        <p>The idea of collecting data to enhance customer experiences is nothing new. Everyone from local greengrocers to big dog bankers have always relied on snippets of information to paint a better picture of their customers.

However, the BIG in ‘big data’ presents businesses with a treasure chest of customer insights that have the power to flip the world of finance on its head.</p>

                            <h3 className="text-center">Why Is Big Data so Important for Fintechs?</h3>
                            <p>Emerging fintechs are unlocking the power of big data to predict customer behaviour and develop sophisticated risk assessments which set them apart from large financial institutions.
                            The velocity of real-time data gives disruptive fintechs and challenger banks the agility to adapt to a changing marketplace. They can implement aggressive strategies at the flick of a switch and leave the big banks scrambling to keep up.</p>
                            <p>The ability to process large data sets allows fintechs to make smarter decisions and create personalised customer experiences. Instead of shooting in the dark or covering their backs with conservative risk assessments, fintechs can use big data to understand their customers on a one-to-one basis.</p>

                            <h3 className="text-center">How Can Big Data Help Fintechs?</h3>

                            <p><strong> 1. Customer Orientation:</strong> Big data helps fintechs create detailed user-profiles and accurate customer segmentation strategies to tailor their services to their individual needs. Sophisticated modelling techniques can provide personalised services which consider an individual’s perception of risk, age, gender, wealth, location and even relationship status.</p>
                            <p> <strong>2. Improved Security: </strong> While fraudulent activity is a common concern among the digital banking world, big data helps fintechs develop reliable fraud detection systems by spotting any unusual transactions. Digital apps also give fintechs a seamless form of communication to alert customers of security threats and protect their cash.</p>
                            <p> <strong>3. Unbeatable Customer Service: </strong> Forget switchboards and waiting hours on end to speak to an account manager. Big data helps fintechs create a digital log of a customer’s banking activity, identify potential errors and provide seamless support. Data and forecasting can also help fintechs recommend the right services/products based on their customers’ individual spending behaviour.

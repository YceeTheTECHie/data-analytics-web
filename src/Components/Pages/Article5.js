                        <p>It is no secret that data analytics can prove to be exponentially valuable for companies of all shapes and sizes. 61% of marketing decision-makers said they struggled to access or integrate the data they needed last year.

Unfortunately, gaining access to technologies capable of analyzing an abundance of data in a short duration is very difficult. While many companies have the means to record large quantities of data, they are simply unable to process and analyze that information effectively.

So, what can organizations do to use data analytics to achieve better insights that engage customers and drives sales?</p>

                            <h3 classNameName="text-center">What Can Big Data Achieve?</h3>
                            <p>The key to using big data is understanding what it can help your business achieve. While big data is frequently associated with marketing and e-commerce, it would be a mistake to believe that data is restricted to those small sectors. Businesses across industries can benefit from data in numerous ways with proper analysis enabling a company to stand out from their competition. Such practices may also be used to detect potential errors before they occur or to prevent fraud, particularly within the financial sector.

For e-commerce companies—such as Amazon and Wal-Mart— their strategy is to use data to their advantage. By carefully evaluating the browsing behavior of their users, these companies better understand their shoppers, their habits, and their needs.</p>
                            <p>Once you have established the purpose of your data, these six steps should help you use data to drive the needs of your business.

1. Data Collection
Now, you should figure out precisely how your business intends to collect consumer data. The possibilities are nearly endless. Some businesses will rely on data from social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter.

It is also possible to collect information from RFID chip readings and GPS results. Another good idea is collecting transaction information.

                            <p><strong>1. Evaluate Data Relevance & Accuracy : </strong> You need to determine the true value of your data. How was the information collected? Information that has been compiled in a haphazard manner may be inaccurate, full of flaws, and simply worthless.

Therefore, it is essential that you analyze the true accuracy of your information before spending an enormous amount of money to analyze the data in the first place. This will help you determine whether or not the data will contain any valuable insights. If it does not, collect the data in a more accurate manner before moving forward.

</p>
                            <p> <strong>2.In-House Capabilities:</strong> Believe it or not, storing and analyzing big data can be a huge and expensive process. Great skill and experience is needed to effectively scour through the information and utilize the associated software. Many businesses have failed to add data analysts to their teams, and this puts them a step behind their competitors. At the same time, many will be unable to maintain and manage their own in-house talent. While it may seem like a good idea to dedicate resources solely to data analytics programs, this might ultimately prove to be a costly mistake.

In order to get the most out of your data, it is pertinent to closely correlate data analytics and IT technologies.

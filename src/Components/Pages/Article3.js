Like many of these positions, the primary role of an analytics consultant is to deliver insights to a company to help their business. While an analytics consultant may specialize in any particular industry or area of research, the difference between a consultant and an in-house data scientist or data analyst is that a consultant may work for different companies in a shorter period of time.

They may also be working for more than one company at a time, focusing on particular projects with clear start and end dates.

These positions are best for those who like change, and those who have a narrowed interest and expertise in a field of study. Analytics consultants are also in a great position to work remotely, another enticing factor about this role to consider.

Compensation varies widely by industry, but $78,264 is a representative salary for the role.</p>
                            <p><strong>7. Operations Analyst: </strong>

While these examples require a basic understanding of data analytics, a skilled data scientist has the ability to create a long-term career in marketing.

Project managers need at least a working understanding of data analytics, and often more.
